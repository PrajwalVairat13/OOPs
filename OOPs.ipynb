What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n","---\n","- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic, focusing on objects with unique attributes and behaviors."],"metadata":{"id":"yItRZqAYXzj7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2.

Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n","---\n","- Inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a mechanism where a new class (derived or subclass) inherits properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (base or superclass)."],"metadata":{"id":"weHqoOHPXzWK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7. What is polymorphism in OOP ?\n","---\n","- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling them to respond to the same method call in different ways."],"metadata":{"id":"4sG5FrrqXzTU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python ?\n","---\n","- In Python, encapsulation, a core object-oriented programming concept, is achieved by bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a class, and then controlling access to these attributes and methods using access modifiers (public, protected, and private)"],"metadata":{"id":"4eXPNd3uXzQM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9.

What are class and static methods in Python ?\n","---\n","- In Python, class methods are functions tied to the class itself, not individual objects, and they typically take the class as the first argument (cls).\n","- Static methods, on the other hand, are functions associated with a class but don't have any special access to the class or its instances"],"metadata":{"id":"g6n-kw34XzCI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["11.  What is method overloading in Python ?\n","---\n","- Method overloading is a feature of object-oriented programming where a class can have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters."],"metadata":{"id":"Q-Y2ATomXy6D"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["12. What is method overriding in OOP ?\n","---\n","- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), method overriding is a mechanism where a subclass provides its own specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass."],"metadata":{"id":"FTIF0jIwXyuo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["13. What is a property decorator in Python ?\n","---\n","- The Python property decorator makes attributes in a class act like read-only properties."],"metadata":{"id":"vqAU9GKzbvmp"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP ?\n","---\n","- Polymorphism is crucial in OOP because it allows you to treat objects of different classes as objects of a common type, enabling code reuse, flexibility, and extensibility."],"metadata":{"id":"wC6TRlGabvjO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["15. what is an abstract class in python ?\n","---\n","- An abstract class in Python is typically created to declare a set of methods that must be created in any child class built on top of this abstract class."],"metadata":{"id":"y069Dhgvbvgg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["16. What are the advantages of OOP ?\n","---\n","- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages, including enhanced code organization, reusability, and flexibility."],"metadata":{"id":"ErSB7uOBbvdt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable ?\n","---\n","- Difference between a class variable (also known as a static variable) and an instance variable is their scope and how they are associated with objects of a class."],"metadata":{"id":"f4sxhnS-bva8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["18. What is multiple inheritance in Python ?\n","---\n","- In Python, multiple inheritance allows a class (the child class) to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes."],"metadata":{"id":"zXpm-qTIbvYE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["19. Explain the purpose of '__str__' and '__repr__'  methods in Python ?\n","---\n","- The __str__ method returns a readable description of an object for users, while __repr__ gives a detailed or technical string for developers and debugging.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"oELhv-VBbvVR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python ?\n","---\n","- The super() function in Python is crucial for implementing inheritance and facilitating code reuse within class hierarchies."],"metadata":{"id":"jy1hMUg6bvSh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n","---\n","- In Python, the __del__() method is a destructor that's automatically called by the garbage collector when an object's reference count reaches zero, signaling that the object is about to be destroyed."],"metadata":{"id":"EVarb5y8bvPg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python ?\n","---\n","- '@staticmethod' doesn't access the class or instance, while '@classmethod' gets the class as a parameter and can modify class-level data."],"metadata":{"id":"XBrlNtjcbvMd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n","---\n","- Polymorphism in Python with inheritance allows different subclasses to define their own versions of a method, and the correct version is called automatically based on the object's class, even when using a common parent reference."],"metadata":{"id":"GLRZkFsjbvJt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["24. What is method chaining in Python OOP ?\n","---\n","- Method chaining in Python allows you to call multiple methods on the same object in a single line of code, improving readability and conciseness."],"metadata":{"id":"Xti7fguUbvGa"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["25.
